        This service uses the force of a super high pressure water jet to provide the cleaning action of an abrasive
        medium minimizing costly sand consumption and eliminating many of the safety, health and environment hazards
        often associated with dry sandblasting.
        Wet abrasive blasting can be applied to clean steel to a white metal finish or remove tightly bonded paint from
        steel and concrete.

        SOMUHLE PROJECTS (PTY) LTD is equipped with the latest technology and vast experience for the cleaning of all
        types of tanks i.e. Vertical or horizontal, fixed or floating roofs containing the full range of petroleum
        products.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following methods of desludging can be used to achieve the desired results:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span></span> Manual desludging - manually bagging product in bio-degradable plastic bags and dumping into
          skips
        </li>
        <li>
          <span></span>Pumping products out of tanks using pneumatic pumps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span></span> Super sucking product from tanks using vacuum trucks.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once the desludging process has completed, tanks are high pressure water jetted to ensure a completely gas-free
        condition and handed back to the client. Where atmospheric condition in a tank is hazardous, crew members will
        enter the tank using under octal conditions using breathing air.

        Cold cutting calls for the use of ultra-high pressure water jetting to cut steel, concrete and composite
        material. The process uses ultra-high pressure pumps ranging from 1000 bar to 2800 bar along with water jet
        abrasives and water jet equipment systems e.g.
