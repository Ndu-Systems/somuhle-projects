          This service uses the force of a super high pressure water jet to provide the cleaning action of an abrasive
          medium minimizing costly sand consumption and eliminating many of the safety, health and environment hazards
          often associated with dry sandblasting.
          Wet abrasive blasting can be applied to clean steel to a white metal finish or remove tightly bonded paint
